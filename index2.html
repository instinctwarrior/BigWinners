    <h2>What is Programming ???</h2>
    <p class="about1"> 
      Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!

      As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language.

Some of the popular Programming languages are Python, C, C++, Java, etc.
